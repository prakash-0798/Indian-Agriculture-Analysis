Indian Agriculture Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

A comprehensive Tableau-based analytical study on **Indian Agriculture**, highlighting major crops, production patterns, farmer distribution, climate exposure, soil types, state-level summaries, and national agricultural strength.

This project focuses on transforming raw agricultural data into **interactive, insightful, and visually rich dashboards** using Tableau Desktop.

**Project Highlights**

  Nation-level agricultural performance  
  Production, Sown Area, Farmer %, Rainfall & Revenue KPIs  
  Statewise agricultural indicators  
  Crop-wise profitability & soil-type distribution  
  Climate risk breakdown (Flood, Drought, Pest Attack, etc.)  
  Multi-product visualization showcasing India’s agricultural diversity  
  Clean layouts, custom color palettes & infographic-style storytelling

**Key Insights from the Dashboard**

**National-level KPIs**
- India produces **₹616 Cr+ tonnes** of agricultural output  
- **139 Cr hectares** sown area  
- **₹4.23 Trillion** total agricultural exports  
- Nation's rainfall average: **1535 mm**  
- Farmer population: **~51%**

 **State Agricultural Strength**
- Top producing states: UP, MP, Maharashtra  
- Revenue distribution across key crops  
- Variation in marginal, small & large farmer percentages  

 **Crop & Soil Distribution**
- Detailed soil-type mapping for:
  - Wheat  
  - Rice  
  - Cotton  
  - Sugarcane  
  - Maize  
  - Pulses  

 **Climate Exposure**
- Flood, drought & pest-attack contributions visualized through bubble charts  
- Seasonal breakdown — Rabi, Kharif & Zaid

**1. Choropleth Map with Multi-Mode Selection**
The Indian map is fully interactive and supports **multiple data layers** through a dynamic parameter called **“Map Mode”**.  
Users can switch between:

- **Cultivation %**  
- **Population %**  
- **Water Availability**  
- **Rainfall Distribution**  
- **Organic Farming %**  

Each selection updates the map instantly using choropleth shading based on state-level metrics.

**5-Year Slicer (Time Selection)**
A custom **5-year rolling slicer** from 2019-2024 allows viewers to explore agricultural metrics across time.  
This helps analyze **year-to-year trends**, rainfall variations, productivity cycles, and crop shifts.

**Drill-Down Navigation (National → State Summary)**
The dashboard includes an **action-based drill-down**:  

  On the **Indian Summary** page, clicking any state on the map or list →  
  Automatically navigates to the **State Summary Dashboard**  
  Displays state-specific KPIs, charts, rainfall, farmer type %, revenue, soil distribution etc.

This feature enhances usability and makes the dashboard behave like a **multi-page BI app**.
